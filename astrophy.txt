The Big Bang was the moment 13.8 billion years ago when the universe began as a tiny, dense, fireball that exploded. Most astronomers use the Big Bang theory to explain how the universe began. But what caused this explosion in the first place is still a mystery.

The pulsating Universe theory, a variation of the Big Bang theory, in which the Universe goes through successive periods of expansion and contraction. At the end of the compression stage, when the Universe is concentrated in a small volume of high density, there is probably a” break-up” of the Universe, called an Bang.



The force of gravity that is holding objects together will be overpowered, ripping apart the space-time fabric and everything in between, like a rubber band stretched too far. 

Observations suggest that the expansion of the universe will continue forever. The prevailing theory is that the universe will cool as it expands, eventually becoming too cold to sustain life.

The Big Crunch hypothesis is a symmetric view of the ultimate fate of the universe. Just as the Big Bang started as a cosmological expansion, this theory assumes that the average density of the universe will be enough to stop its expansion and the universe will begin contracting.
