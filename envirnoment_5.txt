The Cooum River in Chennai has been described as the most polluted river in the country, with high levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) indicating sewage contamination. The causes responsible for the pollution of the Cooum River include:

1. Discharge of untreated sewage: Large quantities of untreated sewage are discharged into the river, contributing to high levels of BOD and other pollutants.

2. Industrial effluents: Industries located along the riverbank often discharge untreated effluents into the river, contributing to high levels of pollution.

3. Solid waste disposal: Improper disposal of solid waste, including plastics and other non-biodegradable materials, contributes to pollution and further degrades water quality.

To treat the polluted Cooum water, a methodology/protocol can be devised that includes the following steps:

1. Preliminary assessment: Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the river water quality, including the identification of pollution sources and their contribution to the overall pollution load.

2. Identify pollution hotspots: Identify specific areas along the riverbank where pollution is most concentrated, and prioritize these areas for treatment.

3. Implement sewage treatment: Upgrade and build new sewage treatment plants to treat the sewage before it is discharged into the river.

4. Industrial effluent treatment: Implement effluent treatment measures for industries located along the riverbank to ensure that they meet the prescribed standards for discharge.

5. Solid waste management: Implement an effective solid waste management system that includes proper collection, segregation, and disposal of solid waste to reduce pollution.

6. Bioremediation: Implement bioremediation measures, such as the use of microbial cultures, to clean up polluted sediments and restore water quality.

7. Public awareness: Educate the public about the importance of clean water and the impacts of pollution on public health and the environment.

Overall, treating the polluted Cooum water will require a long-term, coordinated effort that involves multiple stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, local communities, and the private sector. By implementing a range of strategies and working together, we can help to restore the health and vitality of this vital natural resource.
