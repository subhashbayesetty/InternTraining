The Ganges is one of the most sacred and revered rivers in India, providing water to millions of people living in the Ganga basin. However, it is also heavily polluted due to various factors, including industrial effluents, sewage, plastics, and the disposal of uncremated and partly cremated bodies. The dumping of corpses of COVID-19 victims during the pandemic has only exacerbated the problem, leading to concerns about water quality and public health.

The quality of water in the Ganges has been a major concern for many years, with reports indicating high levels of pollution and contamination. However, during the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a temporary improvement in water quality due to the reduction in industrial activity and human impact. This temporary improvement highlights the importance of reducing pollution and human activity in and around the river to improve water quality and protect public health.

To clean the Ganga River, a comprehensive approach is needed that involves multiple stakeholders and strategies. Some possible ideas for cleaning the river include:

1. Improving wastewater treatment: Upgrading existing wastewater treatment plants and building new ones can help to reduce the amount of untreated sewage and other pollutants that enter the river.

2. Encouraging sustainable agriculture: Promoting sustainable agriculture practices, such as organic farming and crop rotation, can reduce the amount of pesticides and fertilizers that enter the river.

3. Reducing plastic waste: Implementing measures to reduce plastic waste, such as banning single-use plastics and promoting recycling and waste management, can help to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in the river.

4. Restoring riverbanks and wetlands: Restoring riverbanks and wetlands can help to improve water quality by reducing erosion, filtering pollutants, and providing habitat for wildlife.

5. Promoting public awareness and education: Educating the public about the importance of clean water and the impact of pollution on public health can help to build support for efforts to clean the river.

Overall, cleaning the Ganga River will require a long-term, coordinated effort that involves multiple stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, local communities, and the private sector. By working together and implementing a range of strategies, we can help to restore the health and vitality of this vital natural resource.
